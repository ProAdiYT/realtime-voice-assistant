# 🎙️ Murf Falcon Voice AI Assistant
A real-time conversational voice assistant built using **Murf Falcon Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)** such as Deepgram or AssemblyAI.  
This project was created for a hackathon to demonstrate how **fast, natural, and interactive** Falcon-powered speech systems can be.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This prototype allows a user to **speak**, have their voice converted to text (ASR), processed by the system, and then **spoken back instantly** using Murf Falcon TTS.

The goal is to show a functional voice-first application that demonstrates:
- Real-time speech generation  
- Low latency  
- Natural voice output  
- Continuous conversation  
- Securely managed API keys  
- Use of the **1,000,000 free TTS characters** from Murf  

This project can be adapted for:
- Customer support agents  
- Accessibility tools  
- Productivity automation  
- Language learning  
- Narration / storytelling  
- Voice-driven assistants
